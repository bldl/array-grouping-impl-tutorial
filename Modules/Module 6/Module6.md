# **6.0** Implementing _Array Grouping_

It is now time to implement `Array.prototype.groupBy`!

Write the implementation of the function `Array.prototype.groupBy` based on the [specification](../../Specification/Specification_Array_Grouping.md) 


There is not need to start on `groupByToMap`as this can be implemented by just modifying the `groupBy` function. 

Try to adhere to the specification as much as possible. This makes it easier to ensure the functionality outline by the specification is upheld. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
Continue implementing `Array.prototype.groupBy`. 

1. When the implementation of `Array.prototype.groupBy` is finished.Read the specification of `Array.prototype.groupByMap`, write down using your own words what you think you have to change from *groupBy* to implement this. Write down in an md file before starting the implementation. 

2. Start implementing `Array.prototype.groupByMap`,
=======
Good luck! If you are stuck remember all you have learnt: 
- Look at other implementations of previous features with similar specification. 
- Use searchfox to search the codebase.
- Create tests to test the functionality implemented.
