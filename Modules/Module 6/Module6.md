# **6.0** Implementing _Array Grouping_

It is now time to implement `Array.prototype.groupBy`!

Write the implementation of the function `Array.prototype.groupBy` based on the [specification](../../Specification/Specification_Array_Grouping.md) 


There is not need to start on `groupByToMap`as this can be implemented by just modifying the `groupBy` function. 

Try to adhere to the specification as much as possible. This makes it easier to ensure the functionality outline by the specification is upheld. 

Good luck! If you are stuck remember all you have learnt: 
- Look at other implementations of previous features with similar specification. 
- Use searchfox to search the codebase.
- Create tests to test the functionality implemented.
