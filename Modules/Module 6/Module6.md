# **6** Implementing _Array Grouping_

It is now time to implement `Array.prototype.groupBy`.

## **Task 6.1** 
Your task is to write an implementation of the function `Array.prototype.groupBy` based on the [specification](../../Specification/Specification_Array_Grouping.md) and the knowledge you have gained in Modules 1-5.

There is no need to start on `groupByToMap` yet, as this can be implemented by just modifying the `groupBy` function (this is a part of [Module 7](../Module%207/Module7.md)).

Remember to adhere to the specification as much as possible. This makes it easier to ensure compliance the functionality outlined by the specification. 

Tips:
- Look at other implementations of previous features with similar specification. 
- Use Searchfox to search the codebase.
- Create tests to test the functionality implemented.
