# **6.0** Implementing _Array Grouping_

It is now time to implement `Array.prototype.groupBy`!

# **Main Task** Implementing

Start writing your implementation of the function `Array.prototype.groupBy`. There is not need to start on `groupByToMap`as this can be implemented by just modifying the `groupBy` function. 

Try to adhere to the specification as much as possible, in order to ensure the spec is upheld. 

Good luck! If you are stuck remember all you have learnt: 
- Look at other implementations of previous features with similar specification. 
- Use searchfox to search the codebase.
- Create tests to test the functionality implemented. 
- Test parts of the implementation in a test function
