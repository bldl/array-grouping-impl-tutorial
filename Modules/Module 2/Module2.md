# Searchfox

Searchfox is an incredibly strong tool to search the codebase of `mozilla_central`. It enables the developer to look through the existing codebase much easier than diggin through files. This allows for fast location of code that might solve the same problem. 

In this tutorial we will not be specifically describing the usage of Searchfox. The tool is just there if one get's stuck.
