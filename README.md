# Implementing a JavaScript feature in SpiderMonkey


This is a tutorial on how to implement a [TC39](https://tc39.es/) proposal [_Array Grouping_](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-grouping) in the [SpiderMonkey](https://spidermonkey.dev/) JavaScript engine. We explain here how to read the [proposal specification](https://tc39.es/proposal-array-grouping/) and create the implementation which is compliant to the specification. 
The implementation will be mostly written in [self-hosted JavaScript](http://udn.realityripple.com/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Internals/self-hosting), with a tiny bit of C++.


# What you will learn

This tutorial will give an introduction on how to:
- read the ECMA-262 language specification
- implement a TC39 proposal in SpiderMonkey
- test a TC39 proposal with the [Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262) test suite

# Authors

This tutorial is a result of a project originally implemented in Fall 2021 by **Rolf Martin Glomsrud** and **Sigurd Sets√•** within a project course at the [University of Bergen, Norway](https://www.uib.no/en/ii), supervised by **Yulia Startsev** (Mozilla), **Mikhail Barash** (University of Bergen), and **Noeska Smit** (University of Bergen).

In Fall 2022, **Rolf Martin Glomsrud** (University of Bergen), together with **Mikhail Barash** (University of Bergen), have written this tutorial, and **Daniel Liland** (University of Bergen) has followed the tutorial to implement the feature and provided feedback on the tutorial structure and contents.
